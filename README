##VoiceIt: A Music social media application.

VoiceIt is an Android application that allows user to record, discover, and share 30-second sound clips. 

VoiceIt was built by Leonardo Fontes, Seung Jae Paik, Sarah Sukardi, and Grady Xiao for Johns Hopkins' Spring 2016 User Interfaces & Mobile Applications class.

Features:

There are only three activities for this application:
Login Activity
Register Activity
Main Activity

Main Activity contains the toolbar, action overflow bar, and the button tabs.
These elements can be effectively reused by the fragments contained within MainActivity.

Fragments (w. Neat Features):

HomeFeedFragment: (Shows the posts of all users, where you can play, like, and also delete if it's your own post)
Uses the Firebase Recycler View to automatically update the list whenever a post is changed, added, or deleted
Calculates the timestamp of the post automatically every single time you pull up homefeed or when a child is added
The timestamp is users relative time lapse from the creation of the post till now.
It is divided into category of day (d), hour (h), minute (m), and second (s).
So if the post is 1 day and 80 minutes old, the timestamp will show up as 1d only.
